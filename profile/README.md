# Android Vendor Trees Collection
- Vendor Blobs are purely based on proprietary-list.txt included in the Device Tree used in extracting.
- It maybe edited or not edited.
- If you want to request, submit an [issue](https://github.com/Vendor-Blobs/.github/issues).
    - As long as theres existing Device Tree and Android Dump for that specific device, I'll do it.
